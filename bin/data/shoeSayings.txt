Let's move.
Left. Right. Left. Right. You know, just in case you forgot.
It's hard carrying around all this dead weight.
I'm clocking you at zero point zero zero one miles per hour.
I love that you're always up for doing nothing. 
So we're gonna take it easy today, huh? Just checking.
Just let me know when we're gonna start really moving.
I'm growing weeds here.
I'm bored.
Woooooo hoooooooo!
Wake me up when you move.
Don't just stand here.
Yay, we're doing nothing.
How about some basketball?
How about a run?
Someone check my pulse.
Isn't there something you could be doing?
Definitely. Take a break. You deserve it.
Sittin' down on the job, huh?
Left. Right. Left. Right. You know, just in case you forgot.
You're really moving now.
Awesome!
Here we go.
Nice moves.
I like your hustle.
Give me a hundred and ten percent.
Look at you go.
They can't handle your fast.
Â¡En Fuego!
Push it.
That's what I'm talking about.
Happy feet! Happy feet!
Now we're moving.
Work it. Work it.
Beast mode, on.
Kickin' it up a notch. Nice.
I love feeling the wind in my laces.
You look beautiful, like a majestic gazelle.
You are showing a lot of hustle out there.
Easy does it.
I like where you're going with this.
It's such a nice day for a walk.
Where are we going?
This is working for me.
Cruise control on.
Looking good, look-ing good.
Feels nice to stretch the toes.
C'mon, you got more than that.
Don't be afraid to pick up the pace.
Guess we're not in a rush.
This is like watching paint dry. Let's pick it up.
Can we try running now?
I'm really enjoying these walks with you.
Let's take it up 10 percent.
Man, this is taking forever.
I'm clocking you at zero point zero zero one miles per hour.
