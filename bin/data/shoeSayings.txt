Let's move.
I'm growing weeds here.
I'm bored.
Wake me up when you move.
Don't just stand here.
Yay, we're doing nothing.
How about some basketball?
How about a run?
Someone check my pulse.
Isn't there something you could be doing?
I love that you're always up for doing nothing. 
Definitely. Take a break. You deserve it.
Sittin' down on the job, huh?
It's hard carrying around all this dead weight.
Left. Right. Left. Right. You know, just in case you forgot.
Let's do something.
Is your foot asleep? I am.
Just hangin' out.
This is so relaxing.
Finally, a break.
Take a minute, you deserve it.
Booooooooooriiiiiiiiing.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting you?
Sleep mode on.
Easy does it.
I like where you're going with this.
Where are we going?
This is working for me.
Cruise control on.
Looking good, look-ing good.
Feels nice to stretch the toes.
C'mon, you got more than that.
Don't be afraid to pick up the pace.
Guess we're not in a rush.
This is like watching paint dry. Let's pick it up.
Can we try running now?
I'm really enjoying these walks with you.
Let's take it up 10 percent.
So we're gonna take it easy today, huh? Just checking.
Just let me know when we're gonna start really moving.
You must be on crutches. 
Hey, I'm walkin' here!
Make way, comin' through.
You're really moving now.
Awesome!
Here we go.
Woooooohoooooooo!
Nice moves.
I like your hustle.
Give me a hundred and ten percent.
Look at you go.
They can't handle your fast.
Push it.
That's what I'm talking about.
Happy feet! Happy feet!
Now we're moving.
Beast mode, on.
Kickin' it up a notch. Nice.
I love feeling the wind in my laces.
You look beautiful, like a majestic gazelle.
You are showing a lot of hustle out there.
If I had sweat glands, they'd be in overdrive right now.
Yeeeehawwww!
Now we're movin'.
En Fuego!
Half man, half amazing.
You are a machine!
I can't keep up.
You're gonna need a bath.
Keep it up champ.
Spoiler alert: you're awesome.
Love that adrenaline high.
Incredible stamina.
You're so in shape.
Show off.
We can go all day people!
Who wants some of this?
You deserve a standing ovation.
The only person that can stop you is you.
You've just entered legendary status.
You are on some next level stuff.
You are crushing it.
You. Can't. Be. Stopped.
Working up a good sweat.
Work it. Work it.
Un-freakin believable!
Phenomenal.
Bust a move.
That's some ridiculous moves.
What does it feel like to be so awesome?
I can barely keep up.
Can you wipe the sweat from my laces?
You trying to wear me out?
You're keepin' me on my toes, here.
I got tired, just watching you.
You're a speed demon.
Watch out world.
You're oozing awesome.
It feels good to get some of that energy out.
Nice moves.
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
Running looks really good on you.
You are owning this run.
You are killing it.
BOOM goes the dynamite.
Rockets, engaged.
Hope you're wearing deodorant.
C'mon, let's take a victory lap.
Keep moving champ.
Can't nobody hold you down.
I've seen better runs on stockings.
I'd pat you on the back but I don't have any arms.
I'm such a proud shoe right now.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what awesome looks like.
You ran so far, you're going to need a GPS to get back home.
Somebody call 911 cuz you're burning up the road.
Is there a dog chasing us?
Working up a sweat down here.
You in a hurry?
